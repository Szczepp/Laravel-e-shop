# Laravel E-Shop

## Description
 It's a basic yet functional online shopping system, the only thing it misses is an integration with the payment system. 
 You can browse products, add them to your cart, check them out and confirm the order (only for registered users).
 
## Quick guide
* Download and install `PHP 8`, `Composer` and `Apache` + `MySQL` service (e.g. xampp)
* Copy this repository onto your local machine
* Run `Apache` + `MySQL` services
* Create the database with the name specified in your `.env` file in `DB_DATABASE=` 
* In the terminal run `composer update` to download/update the dependencies
* Type `127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser (without http:// or any other prefix)

#### P. S.
For some reasons I didn't use git for this specific project thus it's actually one huge commit.
